        This project distills the internet into 280-character insights. It
        scrapes, parses, and summarizes web content down to short overviews. At
        its core, Tweet-Sized Takeaways uses the open-source
        'facebook/bart-large-cnn' summarization model, hosted through Hugging
        Face's Inference API. This approach prioritizes transparency and
        accessibility over closed-source, pay-per-token alternatives â€” keeping
        things open and remixable. Built with FastAPI on the back-end and Vite +
        React on the front-end, the app supports a responsive dark/light mode
        toggle for a smoother user experience across devices. It's deployed
        seamlessly on Netlify for fast, global access.
